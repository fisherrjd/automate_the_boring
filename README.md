# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - New Edition



Welcome to my Git repository where I share my learnings from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart (New Edition). This repository contains code snippets, projects, and other resources that I've created while working through the book.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:




## Projects

This section will contain the projects I've completed while working through the book:



## Code Snippets

This section contains various code snippets that I found helpful while working through the book:

### Regex

Here are some regular expression patterns and their meanings:

- groups are created using `()` number ordered using `.group(#)` or a list with `.groups()`
- The `?` matches zero or one of the preceding group.
- The `*` matches zero or more of the preceding group.
- The `+` matches one or more of the preceding group.
- The `{n}` matches exactly n of the preceding group.
- The `{n,}` matches n or more of the preceding group.
- The `{,m}` matches 0 to m of the preceding group.
- The `{n,m}` matches at least n and at most m of the preceding group.
- `{n,m}?` or `*?` or `+?` performs a nongreedy match of the preceding group.
- `^spam` means the string must begin with spam.
- `spam$` means the string must end with spam.
- The `.` matches any character, except newline characters.
- `\d`, `\w`, and `\s` match a digit, word, or space character, respectively.
- `\D`, `\W`, and `\S` match anything except a digit, word, or space character, respectively.
- `[abc]` matches any character between the brackets (such as a, b, or c).
- `[^abc]` matches any character that isnâ€™t between the brackets.
- succeed the string with `re.I` to ignore case matching
- `.sub ` method for Regex objects is passed two arguments. The first argument is a string to replace any matches the second is the string for the regular expression
